This is a personal diary/ task manager website application. Here the user will have the chance to register using their first, last name and email and a specific password unique to them. When the user logs in they can go and create their personal diary entry. These entries will be stored in the blog page of the website and the user will be able to view, edit, delete the entry or create a new one. On the calendar page the user will see a calendar on the right side of the page and they can select a date and create a task for that date. Again the user will be able to edit and delete their tasks. All the data such as user information, diary entries and tasks are stored safely in a database.
